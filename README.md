# 🏋️‍♂️ Workout Rep Counter (ESP32 Based)

A standalone **hardware device** that automatically counts workout repetitions in real time using an ESP32 microcontroller.  
Designed for **push-ups, squats, sit-ups**, and similar exercises without relying on mobile apps or internet connectivity.

This project focuses on **reliability, real-time performance, and practical embedded-system design**.

## 📌 Features

- Automatic **rep counting** during workout sessions  
- **ESP32 hardware-timer based multiplexing** (stable, flicker-free display)  
- **2-digit 7-segment display** for live rep count  
- Distance-based motion detection with **noise filtering & hysteresis**
- Prevents **false and repeated counts**
- Adjustable **active zone & exit zone** for different exercises
- **Serial Monitor debugging** for calibration
- Optional **buzzer feedback** on each rep
- Fully **standalone hardware device**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A Ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors body movement  
2. When the distance enters a predefined **active zone**, a rep is detected  
3. A **lock mechanism** ensures only one count per movement  
4. The system unlocks only after returning to a **free space zone**
5. The rep count updates instantly on the display  

This logic closely matches real human motion and avoids accidental double counts.
